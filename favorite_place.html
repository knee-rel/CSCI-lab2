                <h2 class='light'>When did you visit this place?</h2>
                <p class='light'>I visited this place on May 2013. At that time, I recently just turned 12 when my uncle
                    told me that we
                    were
                    going on an adventure. We drove for endless hours and it was exhilirating. We reached this
                    destination
                    called Garden of the Gods. I took lots of pictures in that place.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class='light'>What can you see in this place?</h2>
                <p class='light'>Mostly rock formations that are really cool as they defy the laws of physics. Then,
                    there
                    are breath
                    taking
                    views that overlook cliffs. There is also this museum where Native Americans were showcased in the
                    exhibits.
                    As a historical nerd, I felt much affinity with this place. </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class='light'>Why is this place your favorite?</h2>
                <p class='light'>I love the cold weather as it is the opposite as in the Philippines. The elevation of
                    around 4000+ feet
                    is
                    actually a challenge for the lungs due to the decreased air pressure, but I like it. As a swimmer,
                    it
                    was
                    good practice to encounter this kind of landscape for it toughens up my lungs. Besides that, I like
                    this
                    place because it is a change of environmentâ€“ away from the water. I really am a nature lover and if
                    given
                    the change, I would definitely love to come by and recreate my photos. </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class='light'>What can you recommend when you go here?</h2>
                <p class='light'>I would definitely recommend to bring thick clothing because it's really cold in the
                    area. I'd say consider wearing many layers of clothes to keep yourself warm. Also, expect the air to
                    be really different because we always use a humidifier at home. </p>
