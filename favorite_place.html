        <h3>When did you visit this place?</h3>
        <p>I visited this place on May 2013. At that time, I recently just turned 12 when my uncle told me that we were
            going on an adventure. We drove for endless hours and it was exhilirating. We reached this destination
            called Garden of the Gods. I took lots of pictures in that place.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What can you see in this place?</h3>
        <p>Mostly rock formations that are really cool as they defy the laws of physics. Then, there are breath taking
            views that overlook cliffs. There is also this museum where Native Americans were showcased in the exhibits.
            As a historical nerd, I felt much affinity with this place. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why is this place your favorite?</h3>
        <p>I love the cold weather as it is the opposite as in the Philippines. The elevation of around 4000+ feet is
            actually a challenge for the lungs due to the decreased air pressure, but I like it. As a swimmer, it was
            good practice to encounter this kind of landscape for it toughens up my lungs. Besides that, I like this
            place because it is a change of environmentâ€“ away from the water. I really am a nature lover and if given
            the change, I would definitely love to come by and recreate my photos. </p>
