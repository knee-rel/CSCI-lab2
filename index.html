	I have not discussed the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code 
	in my program with anyone other than my instructor or the teaching 
	assistants assigned to this course.

	I have not used HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code obtained 
	from another student, or any other unauthorized source, either 
	modified or unmodified.

	If any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code or documentation 
	used in my program was obtained from another source, such as a 
	textbook or website, that has been clearly noted with a proper 
	citation in the comments of my program.

            <h3>FACT#1: I speak a little German</h3>
            <p>Do you want me to give an example? Wir können auf Deutsch sprechen, wenn Sie
                mögen. Ja, ich
                spreche
                nur
                ein
                bisschen Deutsch. Ich habe gelernt Deutsch in die Üniversität seit 2020. </p>

            <h3>FACT#2: I am a UAAP player</h3>
            <p>I have been swimming for Ateneo since my senior high school days. I specialize in Breast
                Stroke,
                mostly
                in
                the
                100 and 200 meters but I could also do the Individual Medley and mid-long distance swims. </p>

        <!-- fact number 3 -->
        <section class='caption'>
            <h3>FACT#3: I have vitiligo</h3>
            <p> I was recently diagnosed with a skin disorder that is associated with the immune response, which is
                Vitiligo.
                There may be no cure for it but there are ways to manage its presence.</p>
